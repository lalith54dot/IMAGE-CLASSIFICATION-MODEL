# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-MODEL



Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning a label or category to a given image. It works by processing the input image and identifying patterns or features such as edges, shapes, and textures that help distinguish between different classes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the most widely used models for this task because they are highly effective at automatically extracting spatial features from images. A typical CNN consists of convolutional layers (to extract features), pooling layers (to reduce dimensionality), and dense layers (to classify the image based on learned features). During training, the model uses a loss function—commonly categorical cross-entropy—to measure the difference between the predicted and actual labels and improve its accuracy over time through backpropagation and optimization techniques. The performance of an image classification model is usually evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. This technology has a wide range of real-world applications, including facial recognition, medical diagnostics, traffic sign detection, and agricultural disease identification.
